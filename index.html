        <h1>If You Can See Gabor Filters At Will Then Tell Me About It</h1>
        <p>I can see Gabor filters under certain conditions, along with other visual transformations. I can't find anything about this in the literature.</p>
        <p><strong>Please email me if you can too</strong> - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>savantsight</em> aaatttt <em>tuta.io</em></span> - I'd like to learn more about this phenomenon and how common it is.</p>
        <p>I don't mean hallucinations, but rather something you can start and stop at will if you focus intensely.</p>
        <p>I vaguely recall a paper about proving that the feline visual system uses Gabor filters, but I can't find it at this time. The conjecture was that it's thus going to be common to all mammals. But apparently no one has proven it for humans.</p>
        <p>I plan to create a visual simulation of this phenomenon to better explain. I have a lot to learn about image processing first.</p>
